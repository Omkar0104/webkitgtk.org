<h2>Web content rendering for the GNOME Platform</h2>
<p class="about_section">
WebKitGTK+ is the GNOME platform port of the WebKit rendering engine.
Offering WebKit's full functionality through a set of GObject-based
APIs, it is suitable for projects requiring any kind of web
integration, from hybrid HTML/CSS applications to full-fledged web
browsers, like <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/epiphany/">Epiphany</a>
and <a href="http://twotoasts.de/index.php/midori/">Midori</a>. It's
useful in a wide range of systems from desktop computers to embedded
systems like phones, tablets, and televisions. WebKitGTk+ is made
by a lively community of developers and designers, who hope to bring
the web platform to everyone.
</p>

<h2>Web process separation</h2>
<p class="about_section">
Since adding support for WebKit2, it's possible to build applications that
use the web platform with increased security and responsiveness. The web
is a jungle, but web pages cannot crash the main application or freeze the
UI. WebKitGTK+ also uses process separation to seamlessly support GTK+2 plugins
(like Flash) in GTK+3 applications.
</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p class="about_section">
Access is one of our core values. For this reason, we are committed to making 
the web work for individuals of all ages and abilities, from all walks of life, all
over the world.
</p>

<h2>Support for audio and video</h2>
<p class="about_section">
The web isn't just for reading words. We drive development of the GStreamer
WebKit backend and support full integration of video into page
content and the HTML canvas element. Currently we are working to finish
support for WebAudio and WebRTC.
</p>

<h2>3D CSS transformations and accelerated rendering</h2>
<p class="about_section">
WebKitGTK+ can use the GPU to enable smooth page compositing and
scrolling, as well as 3D CSS transforms and 3D HTML canvas (otherwise
known as WebGL). This makes WebKitGTK+ suitable for a whole range
of games and visualization applications.
