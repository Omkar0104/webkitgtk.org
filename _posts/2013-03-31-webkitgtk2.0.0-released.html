This is the first stable release in the 2.0 series.

WebKitGTK+ 2.0.0 includes both the WebKit1 and WebKit2 APIs and are
built by default. The WebKit2 API is now considered stable from the
API/ABI backwards compatibility point of view. The WebKit1 API is in
maintenance mode, we will continue fixing bugs but we don't plan to add
new API.

What's new in the WebKitGTK+ 2.0.0 release?
-------------------------------------------

  - Fix clip region of windowed plugins in WebKit2.
  - Fix compile warning in WebKit2 unit tests.
  - Fix the build with Python 3.
