=============

The WebKitGTK+ website.

New version of the WebKitGTK+ website done in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
using the style of GNOME project pages.

In order to test it you need to install Jeykyll, you can do it with the
following commands in a Debian based system:

    sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1-dev
    gem install jekyll

And then you can run the command `jekyll` that will generate the site under
`_site` folder. BTW, you can use `jekyll --server` to test it locally.

In order to write a piece of news in the new website you just have to create a
new file inside `_posts` folder using
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax.
